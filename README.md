i'm a high schooler at shanghai. i am currently coding with c++, python and html. 

i'm a heavy video game player. i play minecraft, zelda, honkai star rail and kerbal.

i'm also interested in game dev. i'm still learning, so i may not be really good at it, but things change anyway.

dont add my wechat, though. wechat is dumb, and i check my email more often.
